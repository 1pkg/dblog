# Dev Blog

Hi there 👋 at 1pkg dev blog. My name is Kostinatyn Masliuk,  
I'm passionate software engineer and open source enthusiast.  
I'm mostly focused on distributed systems ⚙️, data intensive applications 🗂️, cloud computing ☁️ and Go,  
but also actively practicing in other forms of software development and trying to keep up with new software trends.
